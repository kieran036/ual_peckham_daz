Forms
We didn't get a chance to go through this in much detail, but it's really important for accessible web development. So I recommend doing a bit extra on this and ask any questions next week.

Other cool stuff we looked at:
•⁠  ⁠https://threejs.org/ - Once this course is over, if you want to get into creative web development - which is in high demand - I highly recommend this course (https://threejs-journey.com/). I have done it and it's really worth the money!
•⁠  ⁠Algorave - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glr2JFtjEH4 https://tidalcycles.org/
•⁠  ⁠p5.js  - Really great for learning creative coding and javascript in general. Making cool/weird things makes learning the language more interesting. Dan Shiffman (codingtrain) has loads of FREE resources https://natureofcode.com/ https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain
